# Ice Detector

PhD Thesis Work. Exploiting proton hopping in dielectric relaxation frequency of water to detect state changes.

This is a micropython project for the Raspberry Pi Pico. It uses a relaxation
oscillator to measure the capacitance of a water sample. The relaxation frequency changes when ice forms in the water.
